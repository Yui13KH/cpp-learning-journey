problem 36 - write a program to dynamically read numbers and save them in an array Max size of array is 100 allocate simi-dynamic array length

in other words ask user for array size , then take numbers from user to fill in the array one by one , keep asking if they want to add or not when they say no return array size and its elements

problem 37
copy array 1 to array 2 using the upper one functino , its easy instead of the user ur letting the computer fill it one by one ( randomized )

38 copy odd numbers from first array to second ( randomized )

39 copy prime numbers from first array to second ( randomized )

40 copy arr 1 to arr 2 , only distinct numbers ( copy only numbers once , if its repeating dont )

41 is palindrome array ,, u just use the flip array function to copy , and check if i to size is same to size to n , idk tbh about optimization i'll about it later

42 count odd numbers in array , see problem 38 , use that to check and use a counter

43 count even .. { i'll just make them in the same file , print both counts of both}

44 count positive numbers only , ( user randomize number in range of [-100,100] )
45 count negative number , again same file

46 create absolute function like the cpp abs function in cpp (it just always return a positive number )

47  create rounding function , and print round from cpp to compare , 
note : rounding negative goes up -10.7 becomes -11  and -10.3 becomes -10  ,  10.7 -> 11 , 10.3 -> 10

48 create flooring function 

49 create ceil function 

50  create sqrt function ( for now only perfect squares )
