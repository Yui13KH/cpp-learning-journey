Here's a simple README based on your description:

```markdown
# 8 Algo & Problem Solving Level 4 - Solutions

This is the corresponding file for the course 8 in Programming Advices, and the solutions I made for it.

## How to Compile

### Using VSCode:
- If you're using VSCode, you can simply press **Ctrl + Shift + B** to compile the file.
- **Note**: You need to have the folder containing the file open on its own, not the entire project, for this to work correctly. 
- Example anything in Algo & problems solving L4 you have to open that as the main folder

### Manual Compilation:
- If you're not using VSCode, you can compile the file manually with the following command:

```bash
g++ filename -o outputName
```

- If the file uses the Utility library I created for easier use, you can compile it with:

```bash
g++ filename Utility.cpp -o outputName
```

Feel free to modify the file names accordingly.
