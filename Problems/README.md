# Algorithms & Problem-Solving Level 1 Solutions

These solutions are based on problems from the **Programming Advices by Abu Hadhoud - Algorithms & Problem-Solving Level 1 Solutions** course.

Abu Hadhoud provides a separate list of solutions that follow **best practices** and **optimal solutions**, drawing from his professional experience in the real job market.

## Purpose of This Repository
I am solving all the problems here **myself** to:
- Compare my solutions with his optimized approaches.
- Understand the differences in problem-solving strategies.
- Learn from his real-world experience and apply these lessons to improve my coding skills.

## File Organization
I won't be creating 50 separate C++ files. Instead, I will organize the problems in a way similar to his course structure:
- **1 file per 5 problems.**  
This will make it easier to follow the course structure while grouping related problems together.
