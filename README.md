# cpp-learning-journey

This repository is for me to improve my C++ skills and enhance my overall problem-solving abilities. I'll be saving all my C++ projects and exercises here as I work through the basics and build a strong foundation. It's a personal space to track my progress and learn along the way.

## A Few Things to Note

Let's be clear about one thing, though: while this is mainly for building better programming fundamentals and algorithms (because C++ forces you to learn the fundamentals), I do have some programming knowledge in JavaScript, so I have a decent understanding of general concepts. And while I don't know if it counts or not, I did play around with C# in Unity when I was younger.

## Special Thanks

Gotta give credit to [Programming Advices](https://programmingadvices.com/) because most of the knowledge, problems, algorithms, and content will be from there, plus some online questions and problems.

## Compilation and Setup

Not sure about your setup, but on mine, here's how you can compile and run a C++ file:

1. Navigate to the directory where the `.cpp` file is located.
2. You can either press `Ctrl + Shift + B` to compile, or manually open the terminal and run the following command:

   ```bash
   g++ file-name.cpp -o outputFileName
   ```

   This will generate an .exe file that you can run by typing:   ./fileName.exe

# Commit Workflow for Solutions

From now on, I will follow a two-commit process for each problem:

1. **Instructor-Style Solution**:  
   The first commit will include the solution that I believe the instructor would use to solve the problem. This version is based on my understanding of the instructor's approach, often using math-based operations to solve the problem.

2. **Improved Personal Solution**:  
   After completing the instructor-style solution, I will improve upon it. The second commit will contain my optimized version of the solution, based on my insights and better understanding of the problem.

### Example Approach

For example, in previous problems (before this commit), I initially followed the instructor's approach using math-based operations. However, these methods broke down when handling very large numbers due to their limitations. To resolve this issue, I switched to a string-based solution, which has no such constraints and works well with larger inputs.

This two-commit workflow allows me to explore the problem from the instructor's perspective first, then improve upon it with my own enhancements.
