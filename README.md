# cpp-learning-journey

This repository is for me to improve my C++ skills and enhance my overall problem-solving abilities. I'll be saving all my C++ projects and exercises here as I work through the basics and build a strong foundation. It's a personal space to track my progress and learn along the way.

## A Few Things to Note

Let's be clear about one thing, though: while this is mainly for building better programming fundamentals and algorithms (because C++ forces you to learn the fundamentals), I do have some programming knowledge in JavaScript, so I have a decent understanding of general concepts. And while I don't know if it counts or not, I did play around with C# in Unity when I was younger.

## Special Thanks

Gotta give credit to [Programming Advices](https://programmingadvices.com/) because most of the knowledge, problems, algorithms, and content will be from there, plus some online questions and problems.

## Compilation and Setup

Not sure about your setup, but on mine, here's how you can compile and run a C++ file:

1. Navigate to the directory where the `.cpp` file is located.
2. You can either press `Ctrl + Shift + B` to compile, or manually open the terminal and run the following command:

   ```bash
   g++ file-name.cpp -o outputFileName
   ```

   This will generate an .exe file that you can run by typing:   ./fileName.exe
