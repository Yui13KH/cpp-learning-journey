# DateLibrary

This is a C++ Date Library project that demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The library offers various methods for handling and manipulating dates, encapsulated in a `clsDate` class. This project showcases key OOP concepts like classes, constructors, destructors, member functions, and static methods. It also includes functionality for checking leap years, comparing dates, and printing the day of the week.

Make sure to be in the directory of the DateLibrary project alone, not the entire C++ project, before running the compile command.

## Requirements

- C++ compiler (g++)
- Visual Studio Code (optional, for easier compilation using tasks)

## Compilation

### Option 1: Compile using Visual Studio Code

1. Open the project in Visual Studio Code.
2. Make sure you have the C++ extension installed.
3. Press `Ctrl+Shift+B` to build the project. This will automatically compile `DateLibrary.cpp` using `g++`.

### Option 2: Compile Manually from the Command Line

1. Navigate to the `src` directory where `DateLibrary.cpp` is located.
2. Run the following command to compile the project:

```bash
g++ DateLibary.cpp -o DateLibary
```

After compiling, you can run the project with:

```bash
./DateLibrary
```
