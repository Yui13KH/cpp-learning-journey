# StringLibrary

This is a C++ String Library project that demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The library offers various string manipulation methods encapsulated in a `clsString` class. This project is designed to showcase basic OOP concepts like classes, constructors, destructors, and member functions.

Make sure to be in the directory of the StringLibrary project alone, not the entire C++ project, before running the compile command.

## Requirements

- C++ compiler (g++)
- Visual Studio Code (optional, for easier compilation using tasks)

## Compilation



### Option 1: Compile using Visual Studio Code

1. Open the project in Visual Studio Code.
2. Make sure you have the C++ extension installed.
3. Press `Ctrl+Shift+B` to build the project. This will automatically compile `StringLibrary.cpp` using `g++`.

### Option 2: Compile Manually from the Command Line

1. Navigate to the `src` directory where `StringLibrary.cpp` is located.
2. Run the following command to compile the project:

```bash
g++ -o StringLibrary StringLibrary.cpp
