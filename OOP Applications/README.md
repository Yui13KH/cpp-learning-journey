# OOP BankSystem

This project is my approach to learning **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** by building a **simple bank system**. The goal was to understand core OOP principles while creating a modular and scalable application. By breaking down the system into smaller, manageable components, I learned how to structure code effectively for long-term maintainability and growth.

This project features various modules like user management, transactions, and UI screens, demonstrating how different OOP concepts like classes, inheritance, and encapsulation can be used to create a clean, organized application.

## How to Compile and Run

1. **Clone this repository** to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:Yui13KH/cpp-learning-journey.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the `src` directory**:

    ```bash
    cd '.\OOP applications\src\'
    ```

3. **Compile the project** using g++ (or your preferred compiler):

    ```bash
    g++ BankSystem.cpp -o BankSystem
    ```

    feel free to change the output file name (`-o App`) if you prefer something else.

4. **Run the executable**:

    On **Windows**, run the `.exe` file:

    ```bash
    ./BankSystem.exe
    ```

    On **Linux**, just execute the compiled program:

    ```bash
    ./BankSystem
    ```

## Project Structure

- **Libraries/**: Contains the core functionality, including user management, transaction handling, and screen/UI components.
- **src/**: Contains the main application file (e.g., `BankSystem.cpp`) and other related source files.
- **Users.txt**: A sample file storing user data.

## Motivation

This project is more of a learning tool than a complete product. Itâ€™s a hands-on way for me to practice OOP principles and get more familiar with software design. It also helped me develop better skills in structuring code for scalability and modularity.

## Future Improvements

- Implement better storage for user data (e.g. using a database ).
- Improve the UI and make it more user-friendly.

Feel free to browse through the code, and don't hesitate to leave feedback or contribute.

Uhhhhh I don't know lmao :3 its open source so you can do whatever you want with it.
